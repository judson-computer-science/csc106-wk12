# Week 12

## Interacting with the File System
Use the starter code in the `filesystem` directory to create a program that takes a file or directory as input and determines if it exists.  If so, and it’s a directory, it will print the contents of the directory.  If so, and it’s a file, it will print the last modified date of the file along with its contents.  Otherwise it will say that it does not exist.
